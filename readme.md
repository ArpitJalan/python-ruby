## Should I Learn Python or Ruby?

At first glance, Python and Ruby appear to be very similar languages. Both are high-level, [dynamic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) languages used for rapid development. What do I mean by dynamic?

Well, with a dynamically typed language you can do this:

```python
>>> variable = 1
>>> type(variable)
<type 'int'>
>>> variable = "Foo"
>>> type(variable)
<type 'str'>
>>> variable = ["bar",10]
>>> type(variable)
<type 'list'>
```

Essentially, I can change the datatype (from an integer to a string to a list, in the above example) at any point in a program. In a statically typed language, this would result in an error when compiled.

Both support multiple programming paradigms as well - e.g, procedural, functional, object oriented, and so forth.
